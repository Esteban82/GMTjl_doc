# (22) World-wide seismicity of last month


The GMT.jl function \myreflink{seismicity} allows to reproduce the original [Example 22](https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/dev/gallery/ex22.html)
with great simplicity. It is not exactly equal in terms of the displayed legend but it is *dynamic* in the
sense that it always plot the last month seismicity and, oh boy, much easier to use.


\begin{examplefig}{}
```julia
using GMT
resetGMT() # hide

seismicity(title="World-wide earthquake activity")
```
\end{examplefig}
