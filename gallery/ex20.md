# (20) Custom plot symbols

One is often required to make special maps that shows the distribution of certain features but one
would prefer to use a custom symbol instead of the built-in circles, squares, triangles, etc. in the
GMT plotting programs \myreflink{plot} and \myreflink{plot3}. Here we demonstrate one approach that
allows for a fair bit of flexibility in designing ones own symbols. 

Based on the hotspot locations in the remote file ``hotspots.txt`` (with a 3rd column giving the desired
symbol sizes in inches) we lay down a world map and overlay red volcano symbols using our custom-built
volcano symbol and \myreflink{plot}. We do something similar with the bulls eye symbols. Without the
**fill** option, however, they get the colors defined in ``bullseye.def``.


\begin{examplefig}{}
```julia
using GMT
GMT.resetGMT() # hide

coast(region=:global360, xaxis=(annot=60,), yaxis=(annot=30,), title="Hotspot Islands and Hot Cities",
      land=:darkgreen, water=:lightblue, area=5000, proj=:Win, figsize=15)
plot!("@hotspots.txt", symbol="kvolcano", markerline=:thinnest, fill=:red)

# Overlay a few bullseyes at NY, Cairo, and Perth
cities = [-74 40.45 1.0; 31.15 30.03 1.0; 115.49 -31.58 1.0; -56.16 -34.9 1.0]
plot!(cities, symbol="k@bullseye", show=true)
```
\end{examplefig}
