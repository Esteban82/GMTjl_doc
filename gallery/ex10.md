# (10) A geographical bar graph plot

Our next and perhaps most business-like example presents a three-dimensional bar graph plot showing the geographic
distribution of all the languages of the world. The input data was taken from [Ethnologue](https://www.ethnologue.com/).
We decide to plot a 3-D multi-band column centered on each continent with a height that is proportional to the
languages used. We choose a plain linear projection for the basemap and add the multi-band columns and text on top.
The different bands in the columns indicate how commonly the languages are used, from institutional languages to
languages threatened by extinction. The script also shows how to effectively use transparency of the boxes around
the numbers and in the shade surrounding the legend. Our script that produces Figure 10 reads:

text!(vec(string.(Int.(sum(D[:, 3:end], dims=2)))), x=D[:,1], y=D[:,2],       # Sum by continents
