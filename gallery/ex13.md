# (13) Plotting of vector fields

In many areas, such as fluid dynamics and elasticity, it is desirable to plot vector fields of various kinds.
GMT provides a way to illustrate 2-component vector fields using the \myreflink{grdvector} utility. The two
components of the field (Cartesian or polar components) are stored in separate grid files. In this example
we use grdmath to generate a surface and to calculate by returning the x- and y-derivatives separately.
We superpose the gradient vector field and the surface z and also plot the components of the gradient
in separate windows. A \myreflink{text} call to place a header finishes the plot

\begin{examplefig}{}
```julia
using GMT
GMT.resetGMT() # hide

gmtset(FONT_HEADING="40p,Times-Italic",)
Gz = gmt("grdmath -R-2/2/-2/2 -I0.1 X Y R2 NEG EXP X MUL =");
Gdzdx = gmt("grdmath ? DDX", Gz);
Gdzdy = gmt("grdmath ? DDY", Gz);
subplot(grid=(2,2), splot_size=15, margins=0.1, title="z(x,y) = x@~\327@~exp(-x@+2@+-y@+2@+)")
	grdcontour(Gz, cont=0.05, annot=0.1, labels=(dist=5,), smooth=4, ticks=(gap=(0.25,0.08),))
	subplot(:set, panel=(1,2))
	grdcontour(Gz, cont=0.05, labels=(dist=5,), smooth=4)
	grdvector(Gdzdx, Gdzdy, inc=0.2, arrow=(len=0.25, shape=0.5, stop=true, norm=0.6),
              fill=:black, pen=1, vec_scale=2)
	subplot(:set, panel=(2,1))
	grdcontour(Gdzdx, cont=0.1, annot=0.5, labels=(dist=5,), smooth=4, ticks=(gap=(0.25,0.08),))
	subplot(:set, panel=(2,2))
	grdcontour(Gdzdy, cont=0.05, annot=0.2, labels=(dist=5,), smooth=4, ticks=(gap=(0.25,0.08),))
subplot("show")
```
